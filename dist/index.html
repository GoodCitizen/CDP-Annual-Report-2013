              <h2>Letter from Lori J. Bertman<br><small>Board Chair</small></h2>
              <p>There is only one way out of New Orleans: through my hometown, Baton Rouge. When Hurricane Katrina struck in 2005 and all systems ceased to operate, philanthropy transformed from a &#x201C;gap-filler&#x201D; to a strong source of leadership that could coordinate across nearly every sector. While we were part of the greatest show of generosity in the history of the United States, the country was ill equipped to make the most effective grants in the wake of such chaos. It was evident that philanthropy was no longer a gap-filler. Instead, we cared about lessening the impact of the destruction and the suffering of displaced families.</p>
              <p>However, we learned that recovery from such an enormous event takes many years, and the money flow slows and eventually stops. From this experience, the Center for Disaster Philanthropy (CDP) was created to provide a full-time national resource to help donors make more thoughtful disaster-related giving decisions and maximize the impact of their gifts. The idea was to transform disaster giving through the collective thought leadership and pooled resources of donors.</p>
              <p>In our second year, CDP raised and donated money to Hurricane Sandy&#x2019;s recovery and will soon allocate money to Typhoon Haiyan&#x2019;s recovery. It has advised foundations, individuals, corporations, and the donor community at large. CDP serves as a real-time knowledge center on disasters. If grant makers and individual donors do not believe that disaster giving is included in their mission, this assumption is incorrect. Disasters at least peripherally impact every population that we serve as well as our economy. At some point, a disaster will hit your community, and CDP will be here for you.</p>
              <p>Special thanks to visionary board members Eric Kessler, Ronna Brown, Henry Berman and John Davies for making this such a special year.</p>

          <h3>CDP Makes Inroads Toward Transforming Disaster Philanthropy</h3>
          <p>Never before have we experienced natural disasters of such frequency and intensity. Yet with each event, donors are giving record amounts with unprecedented speed, often making decisions based on impulse and limited information. These gifts are given with the best of intentions, but donors may question if their money is being well spent and whether they have significantly improved the lives of people in need.</p>

              <p>Center for Disaster Philanthropy (CDP) launched the CDP Typhoon Haiyan Recovery Fund immediately following the storm surge that struck Philippines in November 2013. We designed the fund to emphasize medium and long-term recovery. The Fund will support vulnerable populations, fill gaps where public resources are needed, and foster collaboration among donors and across sectors.</p>
              <p>In 2014, we will allocate the funds in a manner that honors the lives lost and embraces the Filipino culture of resilience. We know that we are not the largest Haiyan funder, however, we know that small dollars strategically invested can bring about powerful change.</p>

              <h2>Letter from Robert G. Ottenhoff<br><small>President and CEO</small></h2>
              <p>It was a year filled with many devastating events including the tornadoes in Moore, Oklahoma; the Western wildfires; Colorado floods; Cyclone Phailin in India; the continued conflicts in Syria and Mali; and the food insecurities in The Sahel and Horn of Africa. The year closed out with one of the worst typhoons in history, Haiyan, which left 6,000 or more dead, caused billions of dollars in damages and destroyed tens of thousands of livelihoods in the Philippines.</p>
              <p>U.S. institutions and individuals responded to these disasters with a generous outpouring of hundreds of millions of dollars in voluntary contributions. Our mission here at the Center for Disaster Philanthropy is to assist donors in making wise decisions about their disaster giving and help increase its effectiveness and impact.</p>
              <p>We accomplished this in three broad ways in 2013:
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>We helped to educate and Inform.</strong> CDP offered a wide variety of free services for donors and prospective donors to educate them about disasters. When to give, and how to be effective givers. Thousands of people relied on CDP website content, participated in webinars, or heard one of our conference presentations in 2013.</li>
                  <li><strong>We provided strategic counsel.</strong> We helped individuals, foundations and corporations with philanthropic ideas to align their unique missions and priorities with their disaster giving strategies.</li>
                  <li><strong>We supported donor collaboration.</strong> More than 25 donors joined together by participating in CDP&#x2019;s Superstorm Sandy Fund resulting in 10 grants to special projects and nearly 20 donors pooled their resources in CDP&#x2019;s Typhoon Haiyan Fund.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>As always, any progress we accomplished this year was made possible through the generosity of our donors, who are listed on the following pages of this annual report.</p>
              <p>We thank you for your interest in our work and we look forward to working with you in making disaster philanthropy more effective.</p>
